### Respectful and Inclusive Behavior
- **Respect**: Respect the opinions and views of others, even if they differ from your own.
- **Inclusivity**: Embrace diversity and be inclusive of all backgrounds and perspectives.
- **Open-mindedness**: Be open to constructive criticism and feedback.

### Creating a Welcoming Environment
- **Be welcoming**: Foster a friendly and inviting atmosphere within the community.
- **Be considerate**: Be considerate of others' time and efforts.
- **Be supportive**: Support fellow contributors and community members.

### Unacceptable Behavior
The following behaviors are considered unacceptable within our community:
- **Harassment**: Any form of harassment, discrimination, or unwelcome conduct.
- **Trolling**: Deliberate intimidation, trolling, or disrespectful comments.
- **Hate Speech**: Use of derogatory language or hate speech based on personal characteristics.

## Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Scope
This code of conduct applies to all spaces within the project, including but not limited to:
- Project repositories
- Issue trackers
- Discussions or forums related to the project

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team leader by @M4ximumpizza. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct. They may also temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Attribution

Regarding contributions:
- **Issues**: These should strictly focus on bug reports or improvements to existing projects.
- **Pull Requests**: Reserved for bug fixes, enhancements, or adding new projects to the repository.
- **New Projects**: Any new project introduced within the repository must comply with the same license as the main repository. It must include a detailed README file explaining the project's purpose, instructions on usage, and ideally, a guide on how to build the project.

This code of conduct aims to foster a welcoming, respectful, and inclusive environment while outlining guidelines for contributions and project additions.
