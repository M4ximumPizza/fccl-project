# Gladiator Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Gladiator Project, a fork of the jdk. Our mission is to significantly enhance various critical aspects of the JDK to bolster security, performance, and functionality.

## Project Goals

### Security Enhancements:
- **Code Analysis and Hardening:** Conduct rigorous code analysis and implement hardening measures to fortify against vulnerabilities.
- **Memory Management:** Improve memory management techniques to prevent common exploits like buffer overflows and memory leaks.
- **Encryption and Cryptography:** Upgrade encryption libraries and algorithms to meet the latest security standards.
- **Access Controls:** Strengthen access controls to safeguard sensitive APIs and resources.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error-handling mechanisms to prevent information leakage and exploitation.

### Compilation Features:
- **Bytecode Optimization:** Enhance bytecode generation and optimization for better runtime performance.
- **Native Code Generation:** Develop a mechanism to translate bytecode into machine code for specific platforms, ensuring compatibility and security.
- **Compilation Switch:** Enable users to toggle between bytecode and machine code compilation based on their requirements.

### Performance Improvements:
- **JIT Compiler Enhancements:** Optimize the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler to generate more efficient native code.
- **Garbage Collection Optimizations:** Refine garbage collection algorithms to minimize pause times and enhance overall performance.
- **Parallel Processing:** Introduce or improve parallel processing capabilities to leverage multi-core architectures effectively.
